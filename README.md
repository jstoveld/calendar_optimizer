Authentication: This component is responsible for authenticating the user with the Google Calendar API. It likely handles obtaining and refreshing access tokens.

Calendar: This class interacts with the Google Calendar API. It fetches events, creates new events, deletes events, and converts events to tasks.

Event: This class represents a calendar event. It likely contains information about the event such as the start time, end time, location, and whether it's an event or a task.

Optimizer: This class takes a Calendar object and optimizes the events in the calendar. It checks for overlapping events, ensures there are gaps between events, converts short events to tasks, and calculates travel time between events.

app.py: This is the main entry point of your application. It likely creates an instance of the Authentication class to authenticate the user, an instance of the Calendar class to interact with the Google Calendar API, and an instance of the Optimizer class to optimize the events in the calendar.

This structure allows your application to authenticate with the Google Calendar API, fetch and manipulate events, and optimize the events in the calendar.
